We are given two arrays A and B of words.  Each word is a string of lowercase letters.  Now, say that word b is a subset of word a if every letter in b occurs in a, including multiplicity.  For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior", but is not a subset of "world".  Now say a word a from A is universal if for every b in B, b is a subset of a.   Return a list of all universal words in A.  You can return the words in any order.
